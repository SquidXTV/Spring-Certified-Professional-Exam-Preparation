## Core Concepts
- Authentication: confirm whether an individual or user is who they are
- Authorization: determines what actions an authenticated user is allowed to perform
- Security Filter Chain
- Authentication Flow
- URL Authorization
- Method Security
- Security in Tests

### Authentication
- Authentication Mechanisms: Basic, Digest, Form, X.509, Oauth 2.0 / OIDC
- `Principal`: currently authenticated user, device or system that performs an action
- `UserDetails`: represents user-specific information such as username, password and roles
- `UserDetailsService`: service for loading user information typically from a database
- `PasswordEncoder`: used to encode and verify passwords securely

### Authorization
- `Authority`: a permission or role granted to a user

### URL Authorization
- `HttpSecurity`: configures web-based security, including which URLs require authentication or specific roles
- `SecurityFilterChain`: a filter chain used to match against `HttpServletRequest`s
- `requestMatchers()`: matching requests against path patterns, HTTP methods, etc.
- `WebSecurityCustomizer`: exclude specific requests from the `SecurityFilterChain` completely

### Method Security
- `@EnableMethodSecurity`: enables method-level Spring Security
  - `prePostEnabled`: enables pre/post annotations
  - `securedEnabled`: enables `@Secured` annotation
  - `jsr250Enabled`: enables support for standard JSR-250 annotations
- `SpringSecurityInterceptor`: a method interceptor that applies security checks at the method level using AOP

##### Pre/Post Annotations
- `@PreAuthorize`: evaluates a security expression before the method is invoked
- `@PostAuthorize`: evaluates a security expression after the method is invoked 
- `@PreFilter`: filtering a collection from the method parameters before the method is invoked 
- `@PostFilter`: filtering the returned collection after the method is invoked 

##### Secured Annotations
- `@Secured`: set the required list of security configuration attributes like `ROLE_USER`

##### JSR-250 Annotations
- `@RolesAllowed`: define the required roles to execute this method
- `@PermitAll`: allows all users
- `@DenyAll`: denies access to everyone


### Security Filter Chain
- `DelegatingFilterProxy`: delegates to filter chains
- `SecurityContextPersistenceFilter`: establishes a `SecurityContext`
- `LogoutFilter`: clears `SecurityContextHolder` on logout request
- `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter`: puts authentication into `SecurityContext` on login request
- `ExceptionTranslationFilter`: converts exceptions into HTTP responses or redirects
- `AuthorizationFilter`: authorizes web requests based on the configuration

### Authentication Flow
1. `BasicAuthenticationFilter`: intercepts incoming request with Basic requests
2. `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken`: a `Authentication` implementation used to hold the username and password
3. `ProviderManager`: delegates the authentication request to a chain of configured `AuthenticationProvider`
4. `AuthenticationProvider`: validates the `Authentication` using the `UserDetailsService`
5. `UserDetailsService#loadUserById()`: loads the user's information to verify authentication request
6. Populates `SecurityContext` with the new authentication

### Security in Tests
- `@WithMockUser`: simulates an authenticated user for the duration of a test
- `@WithUserDetails`: loads a user by username using a real `UserDetailsService`
