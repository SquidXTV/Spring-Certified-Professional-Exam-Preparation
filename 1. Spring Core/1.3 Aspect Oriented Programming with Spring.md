## Core Concepts
- `@EnableAspectJAutoProxy`: enable spring support for AOP using `@AspectJ` style
- `@Aspect`: a modularization of a concern that cuts across multiple classes
- Join point: a point during the execution of a program, in spring it is always a method execution
- Advice: action taken by an aspect at a particular join point
- `@Pointcut`: a predicate that matches join points
- Target object: an object being advised by one or more aspects
- AOP proxy: an object created by the AOP framework to implement aspect contracts
- Weaving: the process of linking aspects with target objects to create an advised object using proxy mechanisms

### Advice Types
- `@Before`: advice that runs before a join point
- `@After`: advice to be run regardless of the way the join point exits
- `@AfterReturning`: advice to be run after join point completes normally
- `@AfterThrowing`: advice to be run after join point exits by throwing an exception
- `@Around`: advice that surrounds a join point

### Pointcut Designators
- `execution`: matching method execution join points
- `within`: matching join points within certain types
- `this`: matching to join points where the bean reference is an instance of the given type
- `target`: matching to join points where the target object is an instance of the given type
- `args`: matching to join points where the arguments are instances of the given types
- `@target`: matching join points where the class of the executing object has an annotation of the given type
- `@args`: matching to join points where the runtime type of the actual arguments passed have annotations of the given type
- `@within`: matching to join points within types that have the given annotation
- `@annotation`: matching to join points where the subject of the join point has the given annotation
- `&&`, `||`, `!`: combining pointcut expressions

### Advice Parameters
- `JoinPoint`, `ProceedingJoinPoint` (for `@Around`): provides information and state available at a join point
- `getArgs()`, `getThis()`, `getTarget()`, `getSignature()`: methods returning the specific state available at a join point
- [Passing Parameters to Advice](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop/ataspectj/advice.html#aop-ataspectj-advice-params-passing)

### Advice Ordering
- `@Order`: annotation to define the order of the advice
- `Ordered`: interface to define the order of the advice

### Proxying Mechanisms
- JDK dynamic proxies: if the target implements at least one interface
- CGLIB proxies: if the target object does not implement any interfaces, creating as a runtime-generated subclass of the target object
- AspectJ compile-time and load-time weaving: applying advice within the bytecode at compile-time/load-time

### JDK dynamic proxies limitations
- final methods can't be intercepted
- proxy is not of the target class type (`instanceof` might fail)

### CGLIB proxies limitations
- final classes can't be proxied
- final methods can't be intercepted
- methods that are not visible (private or package-private) can't be intercepted
