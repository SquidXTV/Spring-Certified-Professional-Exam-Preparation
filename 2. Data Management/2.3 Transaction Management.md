### Spring Academy
- [Transaction Management with Spring](https://spring.academy/courses/spring-framework-essentials/lessons/spring-essentials-transactions-why)


## Core Concepts
- `@EnableTransactionManagement`: enables annotation-driven transaction management
- `@Transactional`: declares that a method or class executes within a transaction
- `PlatformTransactionManager`: programmatic transaction control
- `TransactionTemplate`: callback approach for programmatic transaction execution
- Transaction Propagation
- Isolation
- Rollback
- ACID

### Transaction Propagation
- `REQUIRED`: Support a current transaction, create a new one if none exists.
- `REQUIRES_NEW`: Create a new transaction, and suspend the current transaction if one exists.
- `NESTED`: Execute within a nested transaction if a current transaction exists, behave like `REQUIRED` otherwise.
- `SUPPORTS`: Support a current transaction, execute non-transactionally if none exists.
- `MANDATORY`: Support a current transaction, throw an exception if none exists.
- `NOT_SUPPORTED`: Execute non-transactionally, suspend the current transaction if one exists.
- `NEVER`: Execute non-transactionally, throw an exception if a transaction exists.

### Isolation
- `READ_UNCOMMITTED`: allows reading uncommited changes from other transactions, thus dirty reads, non-repeatable reads and phantom reads can occur
- `READ_COMMITED`: only reads changes that have been committed, non-repeatable reads and phantom reads can occur
- `REPEATABLE_READ`: ensures that multiple reads will return the same data, phantom reads can occur
- `SERIALIZABLE`: provides full isolation by executing transactions as if they were run sequentially

### Rollback
- By default, a transaction will be rolled back on `RuntimeException` and `Error`
- `@Transactional(rollbackFor = <...>)`: define exception types that should trigger a rollback
- `@Transactional(noRollbackFor = <...>)`: define exception types that should **not** trigger a rollback

### ACID
- Atomicity: ensures a transaction's operations all succeed or fail together as a single unit
- Consistency: guarantees that a transaction moves the database from one valid state to another
- Isolation: ensures that concurrently executing transactions do not interfere by isolating transaction
- Durability: once a transaction commits, its changes are permanent and survive system failures
